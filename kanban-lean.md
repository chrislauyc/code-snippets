## Five lean principles
1. Define Value
    value is what customers are willing to pay for
2. Map the Value Stream
    Reference the customer values and identify all activities that contribute to the values
    Activities that do not contribute to the customers' values are discarded
3. Create Flow
    Ensure continueous flow without delay.
    breaking down steps, reconfiguring the production steps, leveling out the workload, creating cross-functional departments, and training employees to be multi-skilled and adaptive
4. Establish Pull
    Just-in-time delivery and manufacturing where products are created at the time that they are needed and in just the quantities needed. 
5. Pursue Perfection

## Four kanban principles

1. Visualize workflow
    like a todo list with columns of todo and done

2. Limit work in progress (WIP)
    Eliminate multitasking, do the top priority work first, identify bottlenecks
    Encourage collaboration until the problems are solved

3. Focus on flow
    Workflow should run smoothly and not stop and start.
    Analyze flow metrics:

    Lead time - how long does it take for a card to move from “TO-DO” to “DONE”?
Cycle time - how long does it take for a card to move from “Doing” to “Done”?
Number of items not started - are you struggling with your workload?
Number of items that are WIP - are you staying within your WIP limits?
Blockage areas - do you see any areas where cards build up, causing a blockage in flow?

4. Continuous improvement
