The necessary action when asking a question is to imagine that you are trying to answer your question. Because you are deep in your problem's weeds, it's easy to forget that the person who answers your question does not have all the context. We should keep this general rule in mind — it's the overarching rule for all the details we go into next.

## Search and Research
```
Before you do anything else, search for a solution to your problem on your own. One thing you should start doing is keeping track of all your research when solving a problem. One easy way to do this is to have a browser window represent a specific search for a solution, and each open tab represents an attempt at solving it. Keeping track of your research is vital because it's helpful to provide examples of similar questions or similar problems and explain why those didn't answer your specific problem or question. It also helps the person answering your question avoid pointing you toward resources you've already explored, and lets them know that you've already put in the work.
```
#### Introduce the Problem
```
The first thing you do when you ask a question￼￼￼￼ is to introduce the problem. The first paragraph of your written question should serve as an executive summary of the problem. All the following paragraphs should fill in the details of the problem.
```
```
An important thing to include in your problem introduction is a precise explanation of how you encountered the problem. Write about the difficulties that kept you from solving it. Describe what you already tried and include the results of the research you've done.
```
```
You should also provide as much detail about the context as possible. For instance, include the language version, the platform version, the operating system, the database type, specific IDE, and any web server information. You should also include your particular constraints. For example, you may not be allowed to use feature A or B that would provide an obvious solution. If you have an odd constraint, it may also help explain why you have that constraint.
```
### Help Others Reproduce the Problem
```
One thing to remember is that not all questions benefit from including code. However, if you include code, definitely do not just copy in your entire program! By having irrelevant details, you make your question much harder to answer and decrease the chances of someone helping you.
```
Here are some guidelines for when to include code in your question.

Minimal
```
Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce your specific problem.￼￼ One way to do this is to restart from scratch. Do not include snippets of your entire program. Instead, create a new program, but only add what's necessary to recreate the problem.
```
```
If you aren't exactly sure where the problem code is, one way to find it is by removing code chunks one at a time until the problem disappears — then add back the last part. This way, you can deduce that the last piece of code you added back is likely the source of your problem.
```
```
Be careful not to remove too much code, either. Keep your question brief, but maintain enough context for clarity.
```
Complete
```
Make sure you include all the portions of the code needed to reproduce the problem. It would be best if you assumed that the person who is answering your question would not write any code to reproduce your issue. Again, remember, do not use images of code—those trying to help you need direct access to the code you include in your question.
```
Reproducible
```
When you include your code, it's also important to tell the reader exactly what you expect the behavior to be. Be sure to show the reader the exact wording of the error message you encountered (if there was one). It's also crucial to double-check that your included example reproduces the problem.
```
```
One other thing you can do is create a live example on a site like sqlfiddle.com or jsbin.com. If you do, make sure you also include a copy of your code in your question. Not everyone will utilize the link to the live example.
```
```
And to reiterate, do not post images of any code, data, or error messages—reserve images for things like rendering bugs—things that are impossible to describe accurately with just text.
```
Proofread
```
Don't send a question you haven't proofread. When you post your question, you should have already read and reread it, taking care to follow all the best practices and making sure your question makes sense. It would be best if you imagined that you're coming to your question fresh, with no other context but the question itself. You want to make your question as easy for someone to answer as possible. Remember, the reader is likely choosing between several questions they could answer. You want your question to stand out as something concise and approachable. Don't forget to double-check your spelling, grammar, and formatting. Keep it as straightforward as you can; you're not writing a novel.
```
Respond to Feedback
```
As feedback and responses to your question begin coming in, respond as quickly as possible. You'll likely receive clarifying questions, and your readers need that clarification to help you.￼￼
